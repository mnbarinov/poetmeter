# PoetMeter

PoetMeter is a Visual Studio Code extension designed for counting syllables in lines of text and generating "Poet Maps" for analyzing text structure. This tool is particularly useful for poets, writers, and anyone who works with structured or rhythmic text.

## Features

- Automatically counts syllables in lines of text.
- Provides real-time updates as you edit your document.
- Generates "Poet Maps" â€” visual representations of the structure of words in a line, distinguishing vowels and consonants.
- Lightweight and easy to use.

### About Poet Maps

Poet Maps are line structures that replace vowels with `|` and consonants with `.` to provide a quick visual representation of text rhythm and flow. These maps are especially effective for analyzing Russian text and were primarily designed with the Russian language in mind.

## Usage

1. Open a text file in Visual Studio Code.
2. To count syllables:
   - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).
   - Type and select `PoetMeter: Count Syllables`.
   - The syllable counts for each line will appear as decorations in the editor.
3. To generate Poet Maps:
   - Open the Command Palette.
   - Type and select `PoetMap: Generate Poet Map`.
   - A new tab will open beside your document, displaying the Poet Maps for each line.
